if first render then go ahead
if not first render and wantMorePosts then go ahead
else dont go ahead


if first render then turn off first render while doing state change
if wantMorePosts then same as above

wantMorePosts will be turned on only by "See more" handler button; but can be turned off by getHome();

---------
Comments will have its own endpoint called /post.
localStorage will store the postobj.
Comments will be the component name; comments to a post will rendered as Post component.
Each Comments component will also have a back button for navigating to parent post.
-----
Comment page should pop the last postobj from localstorage.But after popping it should make it a state.
this new state should have the like attribute which we can increment if user likes the post.when like is done the
component wil re render.But we should not allow user to like more than once.So we create a state called interaction 
which keeps check whether user liked the post or not.

When the user presses the back button we should check if the current post object has a parent post id greater
than 0.If it is true then pop the current post from stack and push the parent post in stack and navigate to 
parent post (/post endpoint).if it has no parent post id just navigate to home page.
